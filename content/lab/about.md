In this lab we are going to introduce the Python programming language that we are going to use to program our RaspberryPi projects.

# Python programming language
Python is a simple to learn yet powerful programming language that was coceived in the late 1980s and nowaday is a widely used programing language backed with a huge community. There are hundreds of modules that can be used for free for almost anything you might need to do. And YES, you can write and run python in the RaspberryPi, and there are modules that allow us to interact with the GPIO ports, the cammera, etc.
